{: .notice--info}

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) has been around for a while and is everywhere, from GitHub `README` files and comments to inline documentation systems like DocC or static site generators like Jekyll.

**SwiftUI** is no exception and, since its 3rd iteration, comes with built-in support to display Markdown using a [`Text`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/text) view.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
  var body: some View {
    Text("""
      **Thank you!**
      Please visit our [website](https://example.com)
      """
    )
  }
}
```

![](/assets/images/better-markdown-rendering-in-swiftui-text.1.png){: .align-center}{: width="50%"}

But this built-in support is limited to inlines (links and text styles like emphasis, strong, or strikethrough), ignoring images and block-level elements.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
  var body: some View {
    Text("""
      ## Try Markdown
      SwiftUI's `Text` view *only* renders
      **Markdown** inlines.
      
      1. item one
      2. item two
         - sublist
         - sublist
      """
    )
  }
}
```

![](/assets/images/better-markdown-rendering-in-swiftui-text.2.png){: .align-center}{: width="50%"}

Markdown is much more than links or styled text. It is a sequence of structural elements like **paragraphs**, **blockquotes**, **lists**, **code blocks**, and **images**, which are unambiguously specified in the [CommonMark Spec](https://spec.commonmark.org). However, the most used specification is [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/), a superset of CommonMark that defines extensions for **task lists**, **tables**, **auto links**, and **strikethrough** text.

## Introducing MarkdownUI

[MarkdownUI](https://github.com/gonzalezreal/swift-markdown-ui) is a library for displaying and styling Markdown content in SwiftUI. It is compatible with the GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec and can display images, headings, lists (including task lists), blockquotes, code blocks, tables, and thematic breaks, besides styled text and links.

Once installed via the Swift Package Manager, you must import the library and create a `Markdown` view by passing a Markdown string.

```swift
import MarkdownUI
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
  var body: some View {
    Markdown("""
      ## Try MarkdownUI
      **MarkdownUI** is a native
      Markdown renderer for
      SwiftUI compatible with
      the [GitHub Flavored Markdown
      Spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

      1. item one
      2. item two
         - sublist
         - sublist
      """
    )
  }
}
```

![](/assets/images/better-markdown-rendering-in-swiftui-markdown.1.png){: .align-center}{: width="50%"}

But it doesn't stop there. You can also use an expressive domain-specific language to compose the contents of a `Markdown` view.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
  var body: some View {
    Markdown {
      Heading(.level2) {
        "Try MarkdownUI"
      }
      Paragraph {
        Strong("MarkdownUI")
        SoftBreak()
        "is a native Markdown renderer for"
        SoftBreak()
        "SwiftUI compatible with the"
        SoftBreak()
        InlineLink(
          "GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec",
          destination: URL(
            string: "https://github.github.com/gfm/"
          )!
        )
        "."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The snippet above shows that the content comprises a second-level header and a paragraph. The paragraph, in turn, is composed of strong text, plain text, and a link, separated by soft breaks.

You can even combine Markdown strings with the domain-specific language to create the view content.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
  var body: some View {
    Markdown {
      """
      ## Try MarkdownUI
      **MarkdownUI** is a native
      Markdown renderer for
      SwiftUI compatible with
      the [GitHub Flavored Markdown
      Spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/).
      """
      NumberedList {
        "item one"
        ListItem {
          "item two"
          BulletedList {
            "sublist"
            "sublist"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Styling Markdown

One of the aspects in which MarkdownUI shines is the functionality it provides for customizing the content's appearance.

The simplest way to change the style in which the `Markdown` view displays its content is to apply a different theme using the [`markdownTheme(_:)`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/gonzalezreal/swift-markdown-ui/2.0.1/documentation/markdownui/markdown/markdowntheme(_:)) modifier. For example, you can apply one of the built-in themes, like [`gitHub`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/gonzalezreal/swift-markdown-ui/2.0.1/documentation/markdownui/theme/github) or [`docC`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/gonzalezreal/swift-markdown-ui/2.0.1/documentation/markdownui/theme/docC), to a view hierarchy.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
  var body: some View {
    Markdown {
      """
      You can quote text with a `>`.

      > Outside of a dog, a book is
      > man's best friend. Inside of
      > a dog it's too dark to read.

      â€“ Groucho Marx
      """
    }
    .markdownTheme(.gitHub)
  }
}
```

{% include gallery id="themes-gallery" caption="The same Markdown content using the `basic` (default), `gitHub`, and `docC` themes respectively." %}

A [`Theme`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/gonzalezreal/swift-markdown-ui/2.0.1/documentation/markdownui/theme) is a unique combination of text and block styles that you can use to customize the appearance of a `Markdown` view.

### Styling text

You can override any text style in the current theme using the [`markdownTextStyle(_:textStyle:)`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/gonzalezreal/swift-markdown-ui/2.0.1/documentation/markdownui/markdown/markdowntextstyle(_:textstyle:)) modifier.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
  var body: some View {
    Markdown {
      """
      Use the `markdownTextStyle(_:textStyle:)` modifier
      to override **any** text style of the current **theme**.
      """
    }
    .markdownTextStyle(\.text) {
      FontSize(24)
    }
    .markdownTextStyle(\.strong) {
      FontCapsVariant(.lowercaseSmallCaps)
      FontWeight(.bold)
    }
    .markdownTextStyle(\.code) {
      FontFamilyVariant(.monospaced)
      FontSize(.em(0.85))
      ForegroundColor(.pink)
      BackgroundColor(Color(.secondarySystemBackground))
    }
  }
}
```

![](/assets/images/better-markdown-rendering-in-swiftui-text-styles.png){: .align-center}

The `markdownTextStyle(_:textStyle:)` modifier takes two parameters. The first is the `Theme` key path to the text style to override. The second is a text style builder that combines one or more built-in text styles, like [`FontSize`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/gonzalezreal/swift-markdown-ui/2.0.1/documentation/markdownui/fontsize), [`FontWeight`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/gonzalezreal/swift-markdown-ui/2.0.1/documentation/markdownui/fontweight), or [`ForegroundColor`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/gonzalezreal/swift-markdown-ui/2.0.1/documentation/markdownui/foregroundcolor).

It's worth noting that CSS properties heavily inspire the built-in text styles, and you can even use [font relative units](https://swiftpackageindex.com/gonzalezreal/swift-markdown-ui/2.0.1/documentation/markdownui/relativesize) with some of them. For instance, the inline code style in the previous snippet uses em units to express that it wants a font 85% smaller than the current font.

### Styling blocks

You can also override any block style in the current theme using the [`markdownBlockStyle(_:body:)`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/gonzalezreal/swift-markdown-ui/2.0.1/documentation/markdownui/markdown/markdownblockstyle(_:body:)-2veql) modifier.

A [`BlockStyle`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/gonzalezreal/swift-markdown-ui/2.0.1/documentation/markdownui/blockstyle) customizes a block by modifying a type-erased view that represents it.

For instance, you can override the current paragraph style to set a different line-spacing and bottom margin. Likewise, you can create a new heading style that uses a different font and a bottom divider.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
  var body: some View {
    Markdown {
      """
      # One heading
      The sky above the port was the color of television,
      tuned to a dead channel.

      It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks
      were striking thirteen.

      # Another heading
      It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks
      were striking thirteen.
      """
    }
    .markdownBlockStyle(\.paragraph) { label in
      label
        .relativeLineSpacing(.em(0.25))
        .markdownMargin(top: .zero, bottom: .em(0.8))
    }
    .markdownBlockStyle(\.heading1) { label in
      VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 0) {
        label
          .relativePadding(.bottom, length: .em(0.3))
          .markdownMargin(top: .em(1.5), bottom: .em(1))
          .markdownTextStyle {
            FontFamily(.custom("Trebuchet MS"))
            FontWeight(.semibold)
            FontSize(.em(2))
          }
        Divider()
      }
    }
  }
}
```

{% include gallery id="block-styles-gallery" %}

The images above show how MarkdownUI adds spacing between block elements, based on their margin preferences.

Given that the base font size in the [basic](https://swiftpackageindex.com/gonzalezreal/swift-markdown-ui/2.0.1/documentation/markdownui/theme/basic) theme is `17` points on iOS and that the `paragraph` style sets a bottom margin of `0.8em`, MarkdownUI computes the spacing between two paragraphs as `17 * 0.8 = 14`.

When computing the space between blocks, MarkdownUI always takes the larger margin. For example, in the snippet above, the `heading1` style sets the top margin to `1.5em` and the font size to `2em`, so MarkdownUI computes the spacing between a paragraph and a heading as `17 * 2 * 1.5 = 51`.

It is important to emphasize that the order in which you apply the view modifiers matter. For example, if you apply the text style before the margin preference, MarkdownUI would have computed the spacing as `17 * 1.5 = 25.5`.

If you want to change the spacing between list items, you should consider that Markdown supports tight and loose lists.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
  var body: some View {
    Markdown {
      """
      Tight list:

      * item one
      * item two
      * item three

      Loose list:

      * item one

      * item two

      * item three
      """
    }
    .markdownBlockStyle(\.listItem) { label in
      label.markdownMargin(top: .em(0.3))
    }
  }
}
```

{% include gallery id="list-spacing-gallery" %}

MarkdownUI ignores the bottom margin preference when rendering tight lists. So, you should consider using the top margin preference to make adjustments.

For loose lists, MarkdownUI considers the bottom margin. In the snippet above, as we didn't define one for the list item, it takes the bottom margin preference of the paragraph style, as list items contain paragraphs.

Since a block-style body returns a view, you can do pretty cool stuff, like letting code blocks overflow in a horizontal scroll view.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
  var body: some View {
    Markdown {
      """
      Include `"MarkdownUI"` as a dependency for
      your executable target:

      ```swift
      .target(name: "<target>", dependencies: [
        .product(name: "MarkdownUI", package: "swift-markdown-ui")
      ])
      ```
      """
    }
    .markdownBlockStyle(\.codeBlock) { label in
      ScrollView(.horizontal) {
        label
          .relativeLineSpacing(.em(0.25))
          .markdownTextStyle {
            FontFamilyVariant(.monospaced)
            FontSize(.em(0.85))
          }
          .padding()
      }
      .background(Color(.secondarySystemBackground))
      .clipShape(RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 8))
      .markdownMargin(top: .zero, bottom: .em(0.8))
    }
  }
}
```

### Creating a custom theme

If, instead of customizing a couple of styles, you want to create a full-featured theme, start by instantiating an empty [`Theme`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/gonzalezreal/swift-markdown-ui/2.0.1/documentation/markdownui/theme) and chain together the different text and block styles in a single expression.

```swift
extension Theme {
  static let example = Theme()
    .text {
      FontSize(24)
    }
    .strong {
      FontCapsVariant(.lowercaseSmallCaps)
      FontWeight(.bold)
    }
    .code {
      FontFamilyVariant(.monospaced)
      FontSize(.em(0.85))
      ForegroundColor(.pink)
      BackgroundColor(Color(.secondarySystemBackground))
    }
    .paragraph { label in
      label
        .relativeLineSpacing(.em(0.25))
        .markdownMargin(top: .zero, bottom: .em(0.8))
    }
    .heading1 { label in
      VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 0) {
        label
          .relativePadding(.bottom, length: .em(0.3))
          .markdownMargin(top: .em(1.5), bottom: .em(1))
          .markdownTextStyle {
            FontFamily(.custom("Trebuchet MS"))
            FontWeight(.semibold)
            FontSize(.em(2))
          }
        Divider()
      }
    }
    // ...
    .listItem { label in
      label.markdownMargin(top: .em(0.3))
    }
    .codeBlock { label in
      ScrollView(.horizontal) {
        label
          .relativeLineSpacing(.em(0.25))
          .markdownTextStyle {
            FontFamilyVariant(.monospaced)
            FontSize(.em(0.85))
          }
          .padding()
      }
      .background(Color(.secondarySystemBackground))
      .clipShape(RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 8))
      .markdownMargin(top: .zero, bottom: .em(0.8))
    }
    // ...
}
```

With that in place, you can use the [`markdownTheme(_:)`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/gonzalezreal/swift-markdown-ui/2.0.1/documentation/markdownui/markdown/markdowntheme(_:)) modifier to apply the custom theme to a view hierarchy.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
  var body: some View {
    Markdown {
      // ...
    }
    .markdownTheme(.example)
  }
}
```

## Get started with MarkdownUI today!

If you've made it this far, I hope I've convinced you that [MarkdownUI](https://github.com/gonzalezreal/swift-markdown-ui) is worth a try.

I've barely scratched the surface, and MarkdownUI has a few more tricks. You can explore the [companion demo project](https://github.com/gonzalezreal/swift-markdown-ui/blob/main/Examples/Demo) if you're interested in learning how to integrate a code syntax highlighter or provide your own (or 3rd party) image-loading library.

Thanks for reading!
